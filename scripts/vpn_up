# At UCI, setting this will determine what permissions you have
# to access stuff, and for which sites your computer will use
# its VPN connection, and for which sites it will not.
#
# The possible values for VPNGRP at UCI are:
#   "Default-WebVPN"
#   "Merage"
#   "MerageFull"
#   "UCI"     <--- this will use the VPN address only for connections
#                  to UCI. all other connections will use your outside
#                  address. Normally this is all most users need.
#   "UCIFull" <--- this will use the VPN address for all connections.
#                  If you are going to be using UC-related sources
#                  that are off-campus, such as system-wide Melvyl
#                  library (melvyl.ucop.edu), then use this.

# to read that password and echo it.  If I find the time, I will add
# that functionality to this script and the instructions. At least
# this will suffice for now, 'just to get things going'.
#
# On the other hand, if you leave PW blank, or empty string, the
# script will prompt you for it.
